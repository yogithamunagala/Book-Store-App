# Book Store Project

## Overview
Welcome to the Book Store project! This is a simple web application developed using Spring Boot, Thymeleaf, and MySQL. The application allows users to view available books, manage their book collection, and perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on books. The primary goal of this project is to provide a functional example of a book management system using the Spring Boot framework.

## Features

- **Add New Books**: Users can register new books to the collection.
- **Edit Existing Books**: Users can update the details of existing books.
- **Delete Books**: Users can remove books from the collection.
- **Responsive UI**: The application features a responsive and user-friendly interface using Bootstrap.

## Usage
- **Home Page**: Displays a list of all books in the inventory.
- **Add Book**: Use the form to add a new book, including details such as title, author, and price.
- **Edit Book**: Update details of an existing book by clicking the "Edit" button next to the book entry.
- **Delete Book**: Remove a book from the inventory by clicking the "Delete" button.
